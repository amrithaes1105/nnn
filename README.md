# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

## Overview
Data cleaning and preprocessing are crucial steps in the data analysis and machine learning pipeline. 
They ensure that raw data is transformed into a clean, consistent, and usable format before modeling.

---

## Data Cleaning
Data cleaning focuses on identifying and correcting errors or inconsistencies in the dataset.

### Common Data Cleaning Tasks
- Handling missing values (removal or imputation)
- Removing duplicate records
- Correcting inconsistent data formats
- Fixing incorrect or invalid values
- Detecting and treating outliers

### Example Techniques
- Mean/median/mode imputation
- Dropping rows or columns with excessive missing data
- Standardizing categorical values

---

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing prepares cleaned data for analysis or machine learning algorithms.

### Common Data Preprocessing Steps
- Feature scaling (Normalization or Standardization)
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature selection and extraction
- Splitting data into training and testing sets

### Popular Preprocessing Methods
- Min-Max Scaling
- Z-score Standardization
- One-Hot Encoding
- Label Encoding

---

## Importance
- Improves data quality
- Enhances model accuracy
- Reduces bias and noise
- Ensures reliable and meaningful results

---

## Conclusion
Effective data cleaning and preprocessing significantly impact the performance of data-driven models. 
Investing time in these steps leads to more accurate insights and better decision-making.
